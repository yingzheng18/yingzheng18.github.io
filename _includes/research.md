My research focuses on interdisciplinary areas of artificial intelligence, networked systems, and network economics.
Specifically, I am interested in how to re-design the serving paradigm and resource allocation algorithms in data centers or edge clouds so that they can efficiently support a wide range of applications.
To achieve this, I continuously learn both the applications and algorithms.
Currently, I am interested in 

- Applications: Large Language Model (LLM) Fine-Tuning,  LLM Serving, Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), etc.

- Algorithms: Combinatorial Optimization, Online Optimization, Markov Decision Process (MDP), Reinforcement Learning (RL), etc.

If you are interested in my research and seeking potential collaboration, feel free to drop me an email at **zhengy18@fudan.edu.cn**.
